# Introduction to FHEVM

Welcome to your journey into Fully Homomorphic Encryption on the blockchain! This tutorial will introduce you to FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) and guide you through building your first confidential decentralized application.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption and why it matters
- How FHEVM enables confidential smart contracts
- The difference between traditional and confidential dApps
- Real-world use cases for FHEVM applications

## 🔐 What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption is a revolutionary cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:

```
Encrypted Input → Computation → Encrypted Output
```

The result, when decrypted, is the same as if the computation was performed on the original unencrypted data.

### Traditional vs. FHE Approach

**Traditional Approach:**
```
1. Decrypt data
2. Perform computation
3. Encrypt result
```
❌ Data is exposed during computation

**FHE Approach:**
```
1. Perform computation on encrypted data
2. Result is automatically encrypted
```
✅ Data remains encrypted throughout the entire process

## 🌐 FHEVM: Bringing FHE to Blockchain

FHEVM is Zama's implementation that brings Fully Homomorphic Encryption to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It enables:

### 🔒 **Confidential Smart Contracts**
Smart contracts that can process sensitive data without revealing it on the public blockchain.

### 🎯 **Privacy-Preserving dApps**
Applications where user data remains encrypted while still enabling complex computations.

### 🏗️ **Composable Privacy**
Different contracts can work together on encrypted data without breaking confidentiality.

## 🆚 Traditional dApps vs. Confidential dApps

| Aspect | Traditional dApps | Confidential dApps (FHEVM) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Visibility** | All data public on blockchain | Sensitive data encrypted |
| **Computation** | On plaintext data | On encrypted data |
| **Privacy** | Pseudonymous only | True confidentiality |
| **Use Cases** | Public transactions, voting | Private voting, confidential trading |

## 🎮 Example: Confidential Counter

In this tutorial series, we'll build a **Confidential Counter** that demonstrates FHEVM capabilities:

### Traditional Counter
```solidity
contract PublicCounter {
    uint256 public counter; // ❌ Value visible to everyone

    function increment() public {
        counter++; // ❌ Operation visible to everyone
    }
}
```

### Confidential Counter (FHEVM)
```solidity
import {FHE, euint32, externalEuint32} from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import {SepoliaConfig} from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";

contract ConfidentialCounter is SepoliaConfig {
    euint32 private counter; // ✅ Value encrypted

    constructor() {
        counter = FHE.asEuint32(0);  // Initialize to encrypted zero
        FHE.allowThis(counter);      // Allow contract access
    }

    function increment(externalEuint32 inputAmount, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
        euint32 encryptedAmount = FHE.fromExternal(inputAmount, inputProof);  // Convert external input
        counter = FHE.add(counter, encryptedAmount); // ✅ Encrypted computation
        FHE.allowThis(counter);                      // Update ACL for contract
        FHE.allow(counter, msg.sender);              // Allow user to decrypt
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Key FHEVM Concepts

### 1. **Encrypted Types**
FHEVM introduces encrypted data types:
- `euint4`, `euint8`, `euint16`, `euint32`, `euint64`, `euint128`, `euint256` - Encrypted unsigned integers
- `ebool` - Encrypted boolean
- `eaddress` - Encrypted address
- External input types: `externalEuint32`, `externalEbool`, `externalEaddress` for encrypted inputs from outside the contract

### 2. **FHE Library**
The FHE library provides comprehensive operations:
- **Arithmetic**: `FHE.add()`, `FHE.sub()`, `FHE.mul()`, `FHE.div()`, `FHE.rem()`, `FHE.min()`, `FHE.max()`, `FHE.neg()`
- **Bitwise**: `FHE.and()`, `FHE.or()`, `FHE.xor()`, `FHE.not()`, `FHE.shl()`, `FHE.shr()`, `FHE.rotl()`, `FHE.rotr()`
- **Comparison**: `FHE.lt()`, `FHE.gt()`, `FHE.eq()`, `FHE.ne()`, `FHE.le()`, `FHE.ge()`
- **Control flow**: `FHE.select()` for conditional operations
- **Random generation**: `FHE.randEuintX()` for on-chain secure randomness

### 3. **Client-Side Encryption**
Data is encrypted on the client before being sent to the blockchain:
```typescript
// Frontend encryption using fhevmjs
const encryptedValue = await fhevmInstance.encrypt32(42);
const { input, proof } = encryptedValue;
// Send encrypted input with proof to contract
await contract.increment(input, proof);
```

### 4. **Access Control & Decryption**
Only authorized parties can decrypt specific data through the Access Control List (ACL):
```solidity
// Contract function returns encrypted value if user is allowed
function getCounter() external view returns (euint32) {
    return counter; // ACL automatically enforces access permissions
}

// Check if user can decrypt
function canUserDecrypt() external view returns (bool) {
    return FHE.isSenderAllowed(counter);
}
```

Client-side decryption (using fhevmjs):
```typescript
// Get encrypted result from contract
const encryptedResult = await contract.getCounter();
// Decrypt if user has permission
const decryptedValue = await fhevmInstance.decrypt(encryptedResult);
```

## 🌟 Real-World Use Cases
